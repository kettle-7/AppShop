# App Shop
An app store designed to allow helloSystem users to download and update software without having to search the internet for a helloSystem build, or even worse, compile it themselves.

## How to help
At the moment I'm looking for help with UI design, if you think that's what you're good at, you can follow these steps:
1. Install /Applications/Developer/Qt Creator.app. This is a great app that takes care of writing code, designing things,
   and translation all in one easy package.                                                                                                                            
2. Open a Filer window and go to /usr/local/share/applications. This shows all of your legacy apps, and Qt Designer puts                                               
   its app entry here.                                                                                                                                                 
3. Open Qt 5 Designer, it should render with a nice icon.                                                                                                              
4. When the window opens, it'll ask you to pick a template. I recommend either *Widget* or *Main Window*.                                                              
5. It'll come up with a drag-and-drop designer where you can move things around, add things, etc, like this:

# App Shop
An app store designed to allow helloSystem users to download and update software without having to search the internet for a helloSystem build, or even worse, compile it themselves.

## How to help
It's a little bit empty in here!

If you have an app you or someone else has made that you'd like in the App Shop, ping me with a GitHub issue and I can take care of compiling, packaging and everything. My current two targets are helloSystem and Linux via AppDirs and AppImages respectively, so you'll need to check through your code for hardcoded paths (like /bin/myExe, /lib/myApp/libme.so, /usr/share/myApp/randomThings.txt, etc.)
